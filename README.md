# Invoice Management Application

Invoice is convenient way to manage and send invoices with PDF attachments, 
and is ideal for small business owners or freelancers who need to keep track of their invoicing.

This is a web application for managing invoices, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).

The application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete invoices, and also generate PDFs and send emails with the invoices attached.

The PDF generation functionality uses the easyinvoice library to create invoices in PDF format, and the file-saver library 
to save the generated PDF to the user's computer.

The email sending functionality uses the nodemailer library to construct and send emails with the generated invoice PDF attached. 

The multer middleware is used to handle file uploads of the generated PDF.

# Biggest challenge

Well for this project there were many moment of biggest challenge. Ranging from the mild heart attack when MongoDB was no longer connected and had server 3000 error and to most stressful Tailwind. However, with the guidance of my lecturer Simon and peers May. I learnt how to beautify my web app using Tailwind DaisyUI. Moving forward my projects will be more presentable.

# Key learnings/takeaways

The main thing I learnt from a softskill approach, in software development there are many tools out there. Explore and discuss with your peers, dont reinvent the wheel.

From a business tech approach, this is one more tool i can use to help freelancers and small business owners.
